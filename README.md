## 🎯 Policy Overview

### Theme: Accountability, Reform, and Engagement (ICARE)

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand policy details</b></summary>

#### 🔴 Corruption-Related Issue
* **Main problem:** Systematic misallocation and opaque awarding of public infrastructure projects (favoring certain localities or contractors), resulting in geographic bias, patronage, and occasional ghost or padded projects.

* **How it appears:** Concentration of projects and budget outlays in politically-favored areas, weak needs-based justification, inconsistent procurement records, and limited public visibility into project selection and spending.

* **Consequences:** Waste and diversion of public funds, poor-quality or unnecessary infrastructure, widened urban–rural inequality, reduced public trust, and weakened service delivery.

* **Evidence to track:** Project locations, approved budgets vs. actual spending, procurement winners and timelines, contract modifications, and implementation/completion records.

#### ⚡ Priority
* **Why this matters:** Infrastructure spending is large and directly affects public services and development; misallocation quickly amplifies inequality and erodes citizen trust in government.

* **Immediate impact:** Equitable, needs-based project allocation improves access to basic services in rural and underserved areas and prevents large-scale waste of taxpayer money.

* **Policy relevance:** Transparent, data-driven oversight enables the Commission on Audit, DBM, DPWH, and LGUs to detect irregularities, enforce accountability, and prioritize projects by demonstrated need.

* **Expected benefits:** Reduced corruption risk, better-targeted investments, measurable improvements in rural service coverage, and clearer evidence for reform and budget decisions.

#### 🏢 Stakeholders
* Which sectors or stakeholders are affected?
Department of Public Works and Highways(DPWH)
Local Government Units (LGU's)
Comission of Audit (COA)
Department of Budget and Management (DBM)

#### 📈 Reform Support
* What reform or decision can your data-driven insights support?
    Our data will support transparency by giving equitable access to infrastructure projects, allocating to not only in urban areas but in rural areas as well. Also, it will support a needs-based approval of projects justifying responsible spending of public funds.

## 💡 Insights and Key Findings 

    After implementing statistical treatment it shows that a a positive linear relationship between average population and average project count by region. This means that, in general, regions with larger populations tend to receive more projects

    Evidence shows that corruption absorbs a significant share of infrastructure spending, undermining public trust and weakening project outcomes.

## 📊 Results and Impact
The DBM should issue a Joint Circular/Memorandum that legally requires all LGUs and National Agencies to allocate a protected minimum percentage of their discretionary budget to the combined sectors of Health and Education.

 Formally integrate a Population-Weighted Infrastructure Needs Index (P-WII) into the Budget Call and the Three-Year Rolling Infrastructure Program (TRIP) review process.

 Mandate that all LGU infrastructure projects funded by national transfers (like the LGSF) submit all procurement and project monitoring data (including geo-tagged completion photos) to a centralized DBM-managed public dashboard.

 DBM budget guidelines should provide a funding bias toward maintenance, rehabilitation, and climate-resilient upgrades ("Preservation CAPEX") in regions where the technical asset quality is rated "Fair" or "Poor."
