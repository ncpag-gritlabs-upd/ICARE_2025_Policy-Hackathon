# ICARE 2025 HACKATHON GUIDE  
### Official Reference for Participants

# 1. What You Must Produce

Teams must submit:

1. **A data-driven problem definition**  
2. **Evidence supporting the existence and nature of the problem**  
3. **A policy solution grounded in your analysis**  
4. **Clear and compelling visualizations**  
5. **A 5-minute presentation video**  
6. **A written or slide-based policy narrative**

# 2. Evaluation Rubric Summary

Judges will evaluate based on:

- **Problem Definition & Data Analysis — 30%**  
- **Policy Recommendation Quality — 30%**  
- **Innovation & Originality — 15%**  
- **Clarity of Presentation — 15%**  
- **Q&A Performance — 10%**

# 3. Suggested Workflow

1. Explore both datasets separately  
2. Identify anomalies, governance risks, or systemic patterns  
3. Connect these patterns to potential institutional weaknesses  
4. Build your policy recommendations  
5. Create visuals that help decision-makers understand the issue  

# 4. Tools Allowed

- Python, R, Excel, Stata, GIS tools  
- Visualizations: Tableau, PowerBI, matplotlib, ggplot2  
- Policy frameworks: theory of change, regulatory impact assessment, design thinking  

# 5. Notes on Data Interpretation

- Avoid making direct corruption accusations.  
- Focus on **structural and systemic issues**, not individuals.  
- Interpret anomalies as **governance risks**, not proof of wrongdoing.  
- Use multi-year patterns rather than single-year outliers.


# 6. Submission Requirements

- 5-minute video presentation  
- Deck or written brief (PDF preferred)  
- Reproducible code (optional but encouraged)  

# 7. Support

Mentors will be available on the hackathon day to assist with clarifications and technical questions.
